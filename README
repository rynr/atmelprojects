You can find the code to my microcontroller projects here.
I use Atmel processors, for more information see http://www.atmel.com/.

Here are my projects:

  FootControl:
    Creating a Midi Foot Controller.

  LED4:
    24 bit LED chaser. I use this one, when i meet somewhere with
    peoples, and it's hard to find each other because of many other
    peoples around.
